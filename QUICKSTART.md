# Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Fastest Way to Run

### Option 1: Use the PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```
This will open two PowerShell windows - one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### Option 2: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd DashboardAPI
dotnet run
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd DashboardUI
ng serve
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:4200**

## ðŸ“± What You'll See

3. **Expenses by Category**: Pie chart breakdown
4. **Recent Transactions**: 10 most recent transactions
5. **Investment Snapshot**: 5 investment positions with returns

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start?
